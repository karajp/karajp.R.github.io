		<p>Randal Pound is a Melbourne based long term painter. He has returned to painting after a career in product design and has experimented with various art styles and mediums in recent years. These mixed artistry skills have developed his Expressionism style. Randal's artworks are abstract but recognisable images conveying people, fields of figures, still life of things left behind and landscapes. He aims to convey emotional response and the impact that people have on the world around them.</p>
